"BASE" is an acronym that stands for Basically Available, Soft state, and Eventually consistent. It describes a set of properties 
often associated with NoSQL databases. Here's what each term means:

Basically Available: This means that the system remains operational and provides basic 
functionality even in the presence of failures or partitioning. In other words, the system is designed to be available for use, 
even if it means sacrificing consistency temporarily.

Soft state: NoSQL databases often prioritize availability and performance over strict consistency. Soft state refers 
to the idea that the state of the system may change over time, even without any input or activity. This characteristic 
allows for more flexible data models and eventual consistency.

Eventually consistent: NoSQL databases aim to achieve eventual consistency, meaning that after a 
certain period of time and in the absence of further updates, all replicas or nodes in the distributed system will converge 
to a consistent state. In other words, the system guarantees that the data will eventually become consistent, but there may be 
a temporary period of inconsistency.

These properties reflect a trade-off between consistency and availability, where NoSQL databases prioritize availability and partition tolerance 
over immediate consistency. It's important to note that not all NoSQL databases strictly adhere to the BASE properties, and the level 
of consistency and availability can vary depending on the specific implementation and configuration of the database.
